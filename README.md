## Description

Battle Tanks is an open world tanks game similar to World of Tanks. The prototype of the game has been created by following the amazing class by Ben Tristem called The Unreal Engine Developer Course. My goal is to build upon this in order to learn Unreal Engine and further better my skills as a C++ developer. To that end, I will be updating this readme with various additions I make as I progress on making this a more complete game. 

`TODO Create a more in depth description of the game. `

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

In order to run this program you must have at least Unreal Engine 4 installed. Please note the code was written using Visual Studio 2015 so I'm not certain if there are any compatibility issues with Visual Studio 2013. 

`TODO Create a more detailed Setup Guide`

### Beginning with BattleTanks

Clone or download the repository and run the BattleTanks.uproject file to have Unreal Engine create a project for you. 

## Usage
